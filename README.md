# Milestone 2 ReadMe

## Project/Team Name: Dining @ RC
Project / Team name: Dining@RC / Team Sk8ter
Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

## Motivation
For students living in Residential Colleges, long queues at the dining hall are a common sight. Students get a selection of dishes on a rotating menu. However, they are unsure which are the most popular dishes which are worth queuing for. Furthermore, to obtain your food, you have to frantically scan the QR code at the front of the queue, select your credits and show your transaction screen. Too many times, we fumble when trying to do these 3 actions simultaneously and tend to hold up the queue.

## Aim
We aim to create a phone application for the NUS Residents who are living in Residential Colleges like RVRC, CAPT, and Tembusu, to browse popular dishes available and easy transaction of meal credits during meal times.

We hope to make the dining experience at campus dining halls quick and enjoyable through seamless stall credit transactions and filtering the food through queries.
